Optimized the menus. They now run around three times faster.
Improved dealing with non-implemented features.
Added (Non-working) settings screen.
Added a basic recording feature. Does not record audio.
Made enemies that shoot in directions other than the cardinals.
Cleaned up and optmized code. Including restructuring some file locations.
Added a .cfg file and moved many previously hard-coded settings there. Need to set these things in the settings screen next.
