Implemented logging. There are two separate handlers for the log file and the console window. They default to DEBUG and WARNING respectively.
Made the game pause when it loses focus.
Somehow managed to break the no scaling option in fullscreen. For now that's going to remain broken.
Added a working fullscreen toggle to the settings screen. It saves your setting in the cfg file too.
Added a working settings button to the pause menu. It saves your current position in the game too.
Added a level selection screen for Arcade mode. It's slightly incomplete, but the rest will have to wait for implementation of levels themselves. (Like thumbnails and descriptions.)
Added sound option to settings screen. It saves to your cfg file too.
Added levels. It's too complicated for this file to list everything about them. I'll list everything about them on the tumblr blog.
