# This file might not ever end up being anything. But if it is, it will be the main hubs for the player to upgrade their ships and progress the story.
# In some ways, it will work similarly to levels, in that there can be dialogs and cutscenes associated with them. In other ways, they will be advanced menus for buying and upgrading stuff.
